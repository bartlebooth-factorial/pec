# Pec: Portable Emacs Configuration

I created this project to make it easy for me to install my Emacs
configuration on new systems.

# Installation

```sh
# assuming Emacs is installed ~/init.el and ~/.emacs.d/ do not exist
mkdir ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/bartlebooth-factorial/pec.git
```

# Documentation

No overarching attempt was made to document this configuration.
Comments in the elisp files are present but probably not very helpful
to other people. I may revise them at some point.
